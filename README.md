### You Only Look Once ( YOLO v1 )

Implementation of YOLO object detection using tensorflow. YOLO is a real time object detection method. It treats both object detection and localisation as regression problems. This is in contrast to previous object detection pipelines such as R-CNN, which had seperate entities for detection and localisation and were far more complicated to fine tune/train. More on YOLO [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640.pdf).
